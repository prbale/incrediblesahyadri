<p>The cave of&nbsp;<strong>Kedareshwar</strong>&nbsp;hosts a big Shivlingam, which is surrounded by water. The&nbsp;<em>lingam</em>&nbsp;is surrounded by four pillars that essentially represent the four&nbsp;<em>yugas&nbsp;</em>of life on earth. The general belief is that the current phase is the&nbsp;<em>Kali Yuga</em>. The day the fourth pillar breaks down will be considered the end of this era. &nbsp;</p>
